\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Introduction}
Human life is very hectic these days. People are busy with their works and don't get sufficient time even to have food properly. Even in these hectic schedules people show 
                         interest to surf through different social networking websites. They do spend lots of time on these websites.
                         
\subsection{What is Solution? - Glancify}
                       Motivated by above mentioned time constraint, we planned to create a Google chrome extension that will arrange all the notifications from different social networking sites
                         in a sorted manner which would help the users to have a quick glance over their notifications, saving their time.
\subsection{Why Glancify?}
To provide updates to the users about all the stuffs happening on their social networking sites without wasting user's time. To make all these updates easily available by providing them the compact form of their notifications in a new tab page.
\section{Scope}
This project has very wide scope, mainly because there are very few
constraints. Any user, who has internet access and is socially active, can
use this product. Also, the fact that social networking platforms are used
all around the globe, the people who belong to the above defined set are
from every corner of the world and thus, the scope of this project covers
a wide range of users.
\section{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Login" button to login to Social Media Platform and add that into a "Card".
    \item "Select the Media" popup with the list of various Social Networking Platforms. 
    \item "ADD" button to "Select the Media" Procedure.
    \item Clicking "GOTO" button or "notifications" will redirect user to corresponding social networking platform.
    \item "Remove" button to remove "Card" and logs user out of the Social Networking Platform.
\end{itemize}
